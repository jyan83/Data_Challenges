# Data Challenges

Some quick data challenges.

## Breast Cancer Detection
You belong to the data team at a local research hospital. You've been tasked with developing a means to help doctors diagnose breast cancer. You've been given data about biopsied breast cells; where it is benign (not harmful) or malignant (cancerous).

1. What features of a cell are the largest drivers of malignancy?
2. How would a physician use your product?
3. There is a non-zero cost in time and money to collect each feature about a given cell. How would you go about determining the most cost-effective method of
detecting malignancy?


## Yammer - Investigating a Drop in User Engagement
Yammer’s Analysts are responsible for triaging product and business problems as they come up. In many cases, these problems surface through key metric dashboards that execs and managers check daily.

### The problem
You show up to work Tuesday morning, September 2, 2014. The head of the Product team walks over to your desk and asks you what you think about the latest activity on the user engagement dashboards.

### Making a recommendation
Start to work your way through your list of hypotheses in order to determine the source of the
drop in engagement.

Answer the following questions:
* Do the answers to any of your original hypotheses lead you to further questions?
* If so, what are they and how will you test them?
* If they are questions that you can’t answer using data alone, how would you go about
answering them (hypothetically, assuming you actually worked at this company)?
* What seems like the most likely cause of the engagement dip?
* What, if anything, should the company do in response?
